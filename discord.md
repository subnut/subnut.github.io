# Don't use Discord!

- Discord employees can see _ALL_ of your data!
- Yes, even _private_ messages!
- ___Anything___ you _ever_ did in Discord has been recorded and saved
- All those data can be (and most probably is being) sold to other companies


See the following links for more information:  
(I will be adding more links here in the future)

# What to use?

Currently, I use, and recommend you to use [Element][1] ([play store link][2])
. It is a client for the [Matrix][3] communication protocol. It is an
open-source protocol, all communication is end-to-end encrypted.

[1]: https://element.io/
[2]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app
[3]: https://matrix.org/

#### _end-to-end Encrypted_ = Nobody can see your messages except you, and the person you are talking to

Why I recommend Element? Because, in my opinion, it looks like Discord.

## NOTE

When you install element app, you will be requested to select a server. Choose
`matrix.org`. It is the official server.

I am planning to start my own server for my friends and family by the end of
this year (2021). Stay tuned!
