    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <h2>I'm <code style="font-weight:lighter">subnut</code>. You might also
      know me as <span style="font-weight:lighter;font-variation-settings:
      'CASL' 0.4, 'slnt' -4">Subhaditya Nath</span>.</h2>
    This is my website (hopefully).<br>
    <strike>It looks terrible because</strike> I hate CSS.<br>
    And it doesn't track you because I hate JS.<br>
    <h4>Here are some things that I like/love (in no particular order) -</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Music, as it keeps me sane</li>
      <li>Coding, as it makes me think</li>
      <li>Physics, as it makes me think harder</li>
      <li>Physics, as it makes me think physically</li>
      <li>Physics, as it makes me run a simulation
  of the world inside my mind.</li>
      <li>Chatting (about things that interest me)</li>
      <li>Learning new (interesting) things</li>
      <li>Teaching people who want to learn</li>

    <table>
      <tr>
  <td>Things I am good at</td>
  <td>Nothing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
  <td>Things I am bad at</td>
  <td>Almost everything</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
  <td>Things I am mediocre at</td>
  <td>Everything that didn't fit in the above two
    categories</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <br>
    That's enough reading about me. Go find something better to do.<br>
