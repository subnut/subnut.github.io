		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
		<h2>I'm <code>subnut</code>. You might also know me as
			Subhaditya Nath.</h2>
		This is my website (hopefully).<br>
		<strike>It looks terrible because</strike> I hate CSS.<br>
		And it doesn't track you because I hate JS.<br>
		<h4>Here are some things that I like/love (in no particular order) -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Music, as it keeps me sane</li>
			<li>Coding, as it makes me think</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think harder</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think physically</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me run a simulation
				of the world inside my mind.</li>
			<li>Chatting (about things that interest me)</li>
			<li>Learning new (interesting) things</li>
			<li>Teaching people who want to learn</li>
			<li>Helping people if I can</li>

			<tr>
				<td>Things I am good at</td>
				<td>Nothing</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Things I am bad at</td>
				<td>Almost everything</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Things I am mediocre at</td>
				<td>Everything that didn't fit in the above two
					categories</td>
			</tr>
