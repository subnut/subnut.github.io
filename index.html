		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
		<h2>I'm subnut. You might know me as Subhaditya Nath.</h2>
		This is my website (hopefully).<br>
		It looks terrible because I hate CSS.<br>
		And it doesn't track you because I hate Javascript.<br>
		<h4>Here are some things that I like/love (in no particular order) -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Music, as it keeps me sane</li>
			<li>Coding, as it makes me think</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think harder</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think physically</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me run a simulation
				of the world inside my mind.</li>
			<li>Chatting (about things that interest me)</li>
			<li>Learning new (interesting) things</li>
			<li>Teaching people who want to learn</li>
			<li>Helping people if I can</li>
			<li>Helping living beings if I can</li>
			<li>Monotonicity</li>
			<li>Specificity</li>
			<li>Stability</li>
			<li>Order</li>
			<li>Peace</li>
			<li><b>Simplicity</b></li>
			<li><b>Freedom</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Here are some things that I hate -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unnecessary complexity</li>
			<li>Coding, as it entices me to sit staring at a screen
				for long durations at a stretch, which in turn
				takes a heavy toll on my already weak eyes</li>
			<li>Proprietary things. Why the f**k don't you follow
				the standards? If the standard is limiting you,
				improve the standard!<br>
				There is a reason standards are called
				<em>standard</em>s</li>
			<li>Closed source software. If you are doing nothing
				wrong to your customers by making them run your
				code, then why don't you show us the source
				too?<br>
				No, don't give excuses like
				<i>competetiveness</i>. You can stop others
				from using your source code by using a simple
				thing called <b>LICENSE</b>. Ever heard of
				that?</li>
			<li>Bribery, Monopoly, and Corporization. These two are
				the reason of <b>most</b> of the problems
				humanity currently faces. Go figure!</li>
			<li>Sh*tty people talking sh*t about things they don't
				even know a sh*t about</li>
			<li>Useless plastic.<br>
				If you are capable of peeling an orange, then
				please for god's sake don't buy a peeled
				orange.  Peeled oranges inside plastic
				containers are meant for people who can't peel
				oranges (due to arthirits, etc.)<br>
				Perfectly capable people buying plastic-encased
				oranges aren't going to help the already dire
				plastic situation of our planet</li>
		</ul>

				<tr>Things I am good at</tr>
				<tr>Nothing</tr>

				<tr>Almost everything</tr>

				<tr>Things I am mediocre at</tr>

					categories</tr>

		</table>
		That's enough reading about me. Go find something better to do.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Still here? Good. Here are some tips to change the world -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Ditch Kindles. Get enrolled at your local library.
				If you ever need to, buy books made of durable
				(preferably recycled) paper. After you finish
				reading it, donate it to the library.</li>
			<li><i>This list shall be updated with more data in the
				near future. I wasn't able to finish this list
				due to time constraints.</i></li>
		</ul>
