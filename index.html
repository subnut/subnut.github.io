		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
		<h2>I'm <code>subnut</code>. You might also know me as
			Subhaditya Nath.</h2>
		This is my website (hopefully).<br>
		It looks terrible because I hate CSS.<br>
		And it doesn't track you because I hate Javascript.<br>
		<h4>Here are some things that I like/love (in no particular order) -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Music, as it keeps me sane</li>
			<li>Coding, as it makes me think</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think harder</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me think physically</li>
			<li>Physics, as it makes me run a simulation
				of the world inside my mind.</li>
			<li>Chatting (about things that interest me)</li>
			<li>Learning new (interesting) things</li>
			<li>Teaching people who want to learn</li>
			<li>Helping people if I can</li>
			<li>Helping living beings if I can</li>
			<li>Monotonicity</li>
			<li>Specificity</li>
			<li>Stability</li>
			<li>Order</li>
			<li>Peace</li>
			<li><b>Simplicity</b></li>
			<li><b>Freedom</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Here are some things that I hate -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Unnecessary complexity</li>
			<li>Coding,<span class="hate-detail"> as it entices me
				to sit staring at a screen for long durations
				at a stretch, which in turn takes a heavy toll
				on my already weak eyes</span></li>
			<li>Proprietary things.<span class="hate-detail"> Why
				the f**k won't you follow the standards? If the
				standard is limiting you, improve the standard!
				There is a reason standards are called
				<em>standard</em>s</li></span>
			<li>Closed source software.<span class="hate-detail">
				If you are doing nothing wrong to your
				customers by making them run your code, then
				why don't you show us the source too?<br>
				No, don't give excuses like
				<i>competetiveness</i>. You can stop others
				from using your source code by using a simple
				thing called <b>LICENSE</b>. Ever heard of
				that?</li></span>
			<li>Bribery and Monopoly.<span class="hate-detail">
				These two (IMO) are the reason of <b>most</b>
				of the problems humanity currently faces. Go
				figure!</li></span>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Things I am good at</td>
				<td>Nothing</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Things I am bad at</td>
				<td>Almost everything</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Things I am mediocre at</td>
				<td>Everything that didn't fit in the above two
					categories</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		That's enough reading about me. Go find something better to do.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Still here? Good. Here are some tips to change the world -</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Ditch Amazon Kindle.<span class="hate-detail"> Get
				enrolled at your local library.  If you ever
				need to, buy books made of durable (preferably
				recycled) paper. After you finish reading it,
				donate it to the library.</span></li>
			<li><i>This list shall be updated with more data in the
				near future. I wasn't able to finish this list
				due to time constraints.</i></li>
		</ul>
